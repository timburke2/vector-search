They are loyal members and allowing the few individuals who meet this criteria on first seems fine since it is only a small group of individuals.  But then there is a total breakdown in the system.</p><p>First, they do it by group.  But whatever group you may be doesn't really have any bearing on where you sit.  In addition, everyone clumps up near the counter. Then before everyone on the flight has stowed their luggage, they call the next group, which leads to people being stuck in the jet bridge. If there was an emergency in the jet bridge that didn't allow people to travel back to the terminal, it would seem so much worse compared to having most people in the terminal or airplane already.</p><p>My question is, why do airports and airline companies do this?  Have there been studies that show this method is superior to doing it by row?  My assumption would be filling the plane from the back to front would be the best method. This way there is no delay for passengers to be seated quickly.  Everyone in the back is putting their bags away which doesn't hinder others from getting to their seat, since people getting on would always be farther forward then those who have already boarded. And it would prevent people from clumping around the terminal door.</p>",

Now the system automatically \"took\" 3,000 dollars to cover the costs up to today (and also said they are going to take the remaining 2,000 dollars in the next days).</p><p>On my internet banking website I see the first transaction has the status \"blocked\", and the 3,000 dollars one has the status \"completed\". But at the end of the day, I have 3,000 dollars less than what I was supposed to have.</p><p>Something like this never happened to me and I don't know if this is normal or if I should do something. I called my bank and they said all the money (5,000 + 3,000) is already in the hotel's bank account and that the hotel should either cancel the second transaction or send me a wire with this money.</p><p>What's the right way to proceed?</p><p><strong>Update (Jul 23)</strong>:</p><p>During these days I transferred more money on the card, but they \"charged/blocked\" (I'm not sure) me 3900 dollars, this time when I asked them the reason they said that was an error on their system and they provided me a letter to forward to my bank to get the transaction reverted.</p><p>I then transferred other 2000 dollars to cover the remaining cost of the stay, and this morning, before I presented at the front-desk to checkout, I discovered they did \"block\" me other 2000 dollars, so I again don't have the money needed to settle the balance.</p><p>Now they asked me to come back in the afternoon (my flight is this night at ~9), they said they will fix the situation...</p><p><strong>Update (Jul 27)</strong>:</p><p>That afternoon they said that everything had been adjusted, that they did release (from their side) all the blocked amounts and that I could just leave.<br>I obviously asked what to do about the remaining 2,000 dollars I owed them and they simply said \"It's all okay\".</p><p>After few days, I got back the 3,900 dollars that were \"accidentally\" blocked, and I have also been charged for the 2,000 dollars I still owed them. This charge happened without my authorization, so I guess they simply assumed it was acceptable to use the authorization they got when I first gave them my debit card.</p><p>I asked my bank about all the money that is still blocked and they see in the system that the block will automatically expire in approximatively 2 weeks, I guess this means they didn't release anything actually, apart for the 3,900 dollars for which I got a letter from them.</p><p>I think this story ends here. For the curious and ones that denigrated me because of not having used a credit card, I asked around few banks in my country, and the credit card that gave me the higher limit provided up to 4,000 euro/month, which obviously wouldn't be enough to pay such kind of stay in the future.</p>",

Another man of the gang does the same thing, even asking for your name and writing it on the plastic pocket. They even give you extra CDs, makes no sense!</p><p>The trouble comes when they all start asking for money, talking about a donation. It begins by $1, $5... and it seems very difficult to say no as the guys do not want to take the CDs back. As they look physically in good shape and likely to have regular workouts at the gym, they appear impressive, and the idea of getting into an argument is just out of the question.</p><p>In the process of taking the money out of the wallet to pay the forced donation, when I was caught in that scheme, I accidentally let them see a $20 bill in my wallet.

        "Body": "<p>In a few weeks, my two kids (6.5 and 4) and I will be in London.  We will need to get from Paddington Station (Heathrow Express terminus) to Euston Station (trains to the North).  I am trying to figure out the safest way to do this.  For the purposes of this question, I am mostly defining \"safe\" as meaning minimizing the amount of time walking along the busy streets with two kids and all our luggage, while in a jet-lagged state.  For example I don't really want to get the Circle line tube to Euston Square then cross over busy Euston Street to get to Euston Station proper.</p><p>My research so far yields the following options:</p><ul><li><p>London taxi.  This seems like a no-brainer, but so far I don't fully understand the carseat situation.  As far as I can tell, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/child-car-seats-the-rules/when-a-child-can-travel-without-a-car-seat\">it is <em>legal</em></a> for the kids (of this age) to travel using adult seatbelts, if carseats are not provided.  However, in the interests of safety, I don't want to travel in a taxi without carseats of appropriate size for my kids.  I've read that <em>some</em> taxis have carseats, but its not clear how common this is.  </p></li><li><p>Tube.  Unfortunately as far as I can tell, there are no direct tube lines from Paddington to Euston station.  I think I'd have to do Circle line to St. Pancras then Northern line to Euston, or Bakerloo line to Charing Cross then Northern line to Euston.  The extra tube change does not sound particularly appealing.</p></li></ul><p>So my question boils down to the following parts:</p><ol><li><p>Is it reasonable to expect to easily get a taxi with carseats at Paddington Station, without an unreasonable wait?</p></li><li><p>If taxis are not an option, then what's the best tube route from Paddington to Euston, bearing in mind luggage and two kids.</p></li></ol><hr><p>A bit more background:  Our journey is actually from Heathrow to Stoke-on-Trent.  After considering safety, I'm hoping this journey will be as relaxed and stress-free as possible, so I'm hoping for as few changes as possible.  Heathrow Express seems to be the most reasonable train out of Heathrow, and Euston to Stoke on Virgin seems like the best way to get to Stoke.  However if there are other options that I've missed, then I'd love to hear them.</p>",

When you board your connecting flight, you realize that a cocktail of 24 hours of dried sweat and 12 hours dried aftershave just do not add up and that the people sitting next to you on the connecting flight are going to have a very uncomfortable flight. </p><p>Is there anything you can do to prevent this awkward situation? </p>",

On the other hand, the problem shouldn't be from my side because I didn't see similar behaviors traveling in neighboring countries (supposedly be similar cultures) e.g. Iran or Georgia and none of the mentioned problems happen within the Turkish university that I want to study in.     </p><p><strong><em>Edit</strong>. In the last two days I learnt some Turkish and I used it. But sadly  I received much worse reactions. Reasons can be more than I know, but the two reasons I believe are that the people don't like to hear different accents (for being a very homogeneous society) and the other is they think I am an asylum seeker that I have to learn their language. Please correct me if I am wrong but I heard from a few other foreign students felt very unwelcome unless they speak English. The comments and answers are general may not be useful for some countries like Turkey but I do appreciate any guidance written. Last word: I love Turkey even I am not feeling unwelcome. And, my BEST regards and wishes for those (even few) Turks who helped me a lot recently. Thank you. :-)</em>      </p>",

Not only is it easier to choose different airports for your outbound and inbound flights, but you can avoid the usual traps if you want to change something later on. I've been in situations where I've needed to change just the outbound flight and the cheapest option was to just buy a new one-way ticket but I couldn't do that because the rigidity of the round-trip ticket prevented a traveler from boarding a return flight if they didn't board the outbound flight. With a round-trip ticket, the whole thing counts as one. If you want to make one little change to one leg of one flight and you can't do it, the whole ticket is wasted. (In the same vein, it seems you also get less flexibility and almost no benefit from putting multiple passengers on the same ticket.)</p><p>So my question is this. Is convenience and a marginal (perhaps even only perceived) cost difference the only benefit to a round-trip ticket? Or is there some other purpose I'm not aware of?</p><p>EDIT Nov 3: I apologize for not considering international travel. It's been many years since I've flown outside of the US.</p>",

I am looking for the cheapest regular fare without short-lived discounts. If however there is a permanent discount that can easily be used available, that is fine. </li><li>by <em>scheduled</em> I mean: not a charter flight or anything similar but a flight that operates according to a schedule, be that \"once a year\", \"three times a day at ...\" or even obscure things like \"on the eve of each soccer world cup\"</li><li>by <em>flight I can book</em> I mean: a flight that can be pre-booked reasonably well either online or in place, without suffering too long of a wait, say ca. 3 months of wait time is fine (so I could plan my travels around that) or a flight that has reasonable availability if I step up to the ticket counter at the airport (being able to fly on the next departure or the one after or within a few days if there are plenty)</li><li>by <em>flight that I can fly</em> I mean: no flight in places that it is impossible hard to get a visa/permission for, e.g. for a EU citizen with sufficient funds and a decent immigration history. So no flights to Russian military bases I guess. </li></ul><p>I do not care, for the sake of this question, about other criteria, such as the length of the flight, the aircraft flown, the airline, country nor even the safety (as long as the pilot is willing to fly, so am I). If any doubt remains, my criteria, are in spirit similar to <a href=\"https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/5064/32134\">those here</a>, i.e. \"has a flight number, I can look it up online and book a ticket\".</p><p>Motivation:<br>It would be a nice travel anecdote to be able to say \"I once was on a flight that cost less than a single french fry at McDo, you could fly too\".

The gate access was already open long before departure time, and passengers leisurely showed up at the counter, had their boarding passes scanned and headed to the jet bridge. No line or big group of people; it happened like if it was train waiting to depart at a terminus station. In fact, after we boarded, other passengers continued to show up on board, in small groups or by themselves, during the next 20 minutes that led to the actual departure.</p><p>Why does not this process get applied to other airlines as well?

Mind you, an international driver's permit (IDP) is a permit only valid if the license is valid too, and thus will not help extend this duration <a href=\"https://liveinthephilippines.com/an-international-driver-what/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">as very well explained here</a>. So, after those initial 90 days, you need to get a Philippine driver's license based on your foreign driver's license. This <a href=\"http://www.lto.gov.ph/license-permit-issuance/284-non-professional-driver-s-license.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">requires a visa valid for one (1) year</a>. However, one year visa's are not given to foreigners, only extensions for one or two months.</p><p>How can one get a Philippine driver's license, with this seemingly impossible requirement?</p><h1>Long version</h1><h2>First 90 days since arrival</h2><p>According to my understanding of <a href=\"http://www.lto.gov.ph/frequently-asked-questions/license-permit.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this FAQ</a> on the LTO (Land Transportation Office of the Philipppines):</p><blockquote>  <ol start=\"2\">  <li>I have a valid foreign driver’s license. Can I use it in the Philippines?</li>  </ol>    <p>Yes, 90 days from date of arrival.</p>    <ol start=\"3\">  <li>Can I convert my foreign driver’s license into Philippine driver’s license?</li>  </ol>    <p>Yes. If valid, no exams. (...)</p></blockquote><p>The first 90 days from date of arrival, I will be able to drive using my (foreign) driver's license (and passport), as long as they have not expired.</p><h2>About that International Driver's Permit</h2><p>Note that an International Driver's Permit (IDP) is not required, and will also not extend the time to drive on a foreign license in the Philippines, <a href=\"https://liveinthephilippines.com/an-international-driver-what/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">as explained here</a>:</p><blockquote>  <p>As clearly stated on the IDP itself, it is <strong>ONLY valid when your home country license is valid.</strong>  Ninety days after you last arrival in the Philippines your home country license is no longer valid for driving in the Philippines … thus your <strong>IDP is also no longer valid for driving in the Philippines.</strong>  It’s basically a useless piece of paper.</p></blockquote><h2>After 90 days of arrival</h2><p>In order to keep driving in the Philippines, it seems one has to get a Philippine driver's license, for which one may skip the exams as one already has a foreign driver's license (badly termed as \"converting\" as it is rather \"duplicating\").</p><p>So, let's get to it, <a href=\"http://www.lto.gov.ph/license-permit-issuance/284-non-professional-driver-s-license.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the qualifications to get a Philippine driver's license</a>:</p><blockquote>  <ol>  <li>Must be at least eighteen (18) years old</li>  <li>Must be physically and mentally fit to operate a motor vehicle;</li>  <li>Must be able to read and write Filipino, English or the applicable local dialect;</li>  <li>Must be a holder of a valid SP issued at least thirty (30) days prior to the application; and</li>  <li>In addition, for foreigners, the applicant must have been in the Philippines for at least one (1) month with proof that he/she will stay in the country for at least one (1) year from date of application.</li>  </ol></blockquote><p>First off, the 4th item talks about an SP (I presume a Student Permit). However, foreigners cannot get an SP without having been for at least one year in the Philippines. I think this is probably an error in the qualifications. And as such I will ignore it, correct me if I'm wrong.</p><p>Next, we need to consider the 5th item. If one plans to stay for half a year, it would be impossible to drive in the last few months in the Philippines. Let's first elaborate on the 5th item, which is listed under <a href=\"http://www.lto.gov.ph/license-permit-issuance/284-non-professional-driver-s-license.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">REQUIREMENTS</a>:</p><blockquote>  <p><strong>1. New application/conversion</strong></p>    <p>(...)</p>    <p>d. In addition, for foreigners, original and photocopy of passport with entry of at least one (1) month and visa duration of at least one (1) year from date of application, or if born in the Philippines, present original and photocopy of birth certificate duly authenticated by the NSO.</p>    <p>In the event that the applicant is a holder of a valid Foreign Driver's License, the applicant may present the original and photocopy of Foreign Driver's License, if not in English language, original and photocopy of official English translation from Embassy of the issuing country instead of an SP.</p></blockquote><p>Hence, the proof as mentioned in the qualifications must refer to the \"visa duration of at least one (1) year from date of application).\"</p><p>And this is the problem. Even if you intend on staying in the Philippines for over a year, no visa is issued to \"regular\" foreigners that has such a duration. Currently, the maximum duration by which a visa can be extended is 6 months.</p>",

        "Title": "Does the European number for emergencies (112) really work in Germany?",
        "Body": "<p>One night of some months ago I realized there were some burglars in the apartment below mine. As an Italian living in Germany, I didn't know the number to call the police, but I knew that in all Europe there's a common number for emergencies, 112, and I was confident it was enough. I dialled it and started to explain what had happened. Some seconds later, I was interrupted: \"In this case you need the police. This is the fire brigade. Please call 110.\" They didn't even offer to transfer the call themselves. Maybe I could have asked for that, but I didn't think about it. So I just hung up and dialled 110, and at last I was able to talk to the police.</p><p>Some months later I saw a fire in the building in front of mine (apparently I live in a place where you can't get bored), and I called the fire brigade. I dialled 112 and spoke with them. It was the right number.</p><p>So, it seems to me that 112 isn't really working as expected: it's just the number of the fire brigade, full stop. But as far as I can tell, this shouldn't be the case. According to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/112\">the official website of the European Commission</a>,</p><blockquote>  <ul>  <li><p>You can call 112 from fixed and mobile phones to contact any  emergency service: an ambulance, the fire brigade <strong>or the police</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>A specially trained operator will answer any 112 call. <strong>The operator  will either deal with the request directly or transfer the call to  the most appropriate emergency service</strong> depending on the national  organisation of emergency services.</p></li>  </ul></blockquote><p>Then, according to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-rules-112\">another page</a> on the same site,</p><blockquote>  <p>112 calls must be appropriately answered and handled, <strong>irrespective of whether other emergency numbers exist</strong> in a specific country;</p>    <p><strong>The European Commission ensures that European rules on 112 are correctly applied in the European Union</strong> and has launched 17 infringement proceedings against Member States that have not complied with the relevant requirements of EU law. All cases are now closed following corrective measures in the countries concerned.</p></blockquote><p>It seems to me that calling 112 should have been enough. But there's even more!<br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(emergency_telephone_number)\">Wikipedia</a> says this about 112:</p><blockquote>  <p>112 is a part of the GSM standard and all GSM-compatible telephone handsets are able to dial 112 even when locked or with no SIM card present.</p></blockquote><p>But then, again the site of the European Commission, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/112-germany\">on another page specific to Germany</a>, says:</p><blockquote>  <p>It is not possible to call 112 from a mobile phone without a SIM card.</p></blockquote><p>So, questions:</p><ol><li><p>Why wasn't my call properly dealt with? Calling 112 made me lose around 30 seconds, maybe more. In an emergency this could make a huge difference. Why did it happen? Isn't this a violation of European rules? Is it normal? Has anyone had similar experiences?</p></li><li><p>I recently bought a new phone, but I'm still keeping my old one, without a SIM card. Would I be able to use it to call 112, as per the GSM standard, or not?</p></li><li><p>When I called 112 I used my Italian SIM card. Then, when they told me to call 110, I thought that being a \"non standard\" number there could have been problems, and I picked up my German phone and used that. If I had used my Italian number again, would it have worked?</p></li></ol><p>Regarding 2) and 3), unfortunately calling 112 or 110 if there's no emergency is a crime, otherwise I would just test it.</p>",

Are there locations around the world where one could get farther by only utilizing free transportation?</p><p>The exact limitations are:</p><ul><li>The method of transportation must be completely free of charge.</li><li>You cannot use any forms of self-propelled transport, such as bicycles. However you can use rickshaws or other forms of transport propelled by other humans.</li><li>The location where the transport is located must be publicly accessible free of charge. This excludes things like animal safaris where you pay an entrance fee, but then get to use the buses free of charge.</li><li>It must be available free of charge to any person regardless of citizenship, residency, age, occupation, gender or any other characteristic. This would disqualify <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport_in_Tallinn\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tallinn's public transit system</a>, as it's only free for local residents. This likewise excludes Israel's system where transportation is free of charge for soldiers.</li><li>You cannot walk for more than 500 meters at a time to switch between two stops. You cannot make use of paid transportation to switch between stops.</li><li>Only distance as the crow flies between the two farthest stops counts, not the total distance spent within the vehicle.</li><li>A stop is defined as a location where you can board or exit the free method of transportation.</li><li>The transport must run regularly, not just as a one-off event.</li><li>It must be free regularly, not just during special events. E.g. in some cities public transit is free during NYE celebrations. It's okay if it's only free on weekends for example, as long as it's every weekend.</li><li>It's okay if you need to own a standard public transit card to use the free transport. E.g. it's okay if you need to own an Oyster card to use a given free bus in London, as long as no money is substracted from the Oyster card when you use.</li><li>It's okay if you need to pay a fee to receive a visa to that country or need to spend some money to fly to that country first (thanks, @vsz)</li><li>It's okay if the method of transportation is only free if you use a \"hack\" of some sort (thanks, @gparyani), as long as this hack allows for unlimited free transportation.

However these seem to be lacking in detail in terms of paths, landmarks, facilities, vegetation etc. Are there any US maps better suited to outdoor pursuits than the USGS topo maps?</p><p>It occurs to me that the US may not have a single national answer to the question. If it helps, I'm interested especially in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks and surrounding areas, and areas close to Idaho Falls.</p><p>Paying for the maps is not a particular concern (although cheaper is always better). It would be useful to know what the availability (local stores, book stores, gas stations, internet/ etc) of suggested maps is.</p>",

Whether or not rail privatisation is a good thing is still very much up for debate, but even most pro-privatisation people feel the way it was done wasn't the right way!

The A-C journey is to be operated by TrainCoA, C-D by TrainCoB. Unfortunately, the A-C train is cancelled, so you end up getting a later train A-B, another B-C, and then a later train than you'd planned C-D. Oh, and then the C-D train you eventually caught was very late too. Everything was bought on a single ticket.</p><p>In this situation, which train company do claim compensation from? TrainCoA, as their initial cancellation was your first delay? TrainCoB, as their C-D delay was the largest delay on your journey? TrainCoC, who ran the A-B journey that you got instead, as they were the first company who's trains you managed to take? Or can you take advantage of the privatised nature of the system, review the compensation policies of all three train operating companies, and apply for compensation from whichever company has the most generous compensation for your sequence of delays? (Many of the companies have different minimum delays before compensation is due, and different exclusions on what their delay compensation covers....)</p>",

For the same exact flight, looking from two different tabs in my browser (one in which I was logged in to the airline system, one in which I was not), the price of the luggage option was significantly different (around 12 euros out of 25; the price of the flight was instead the same).</p><p>I know and understand that, in order to maximize profit, airlines use cookies and track customers to charge more when demand is higher.

        "Body": "<p>I am a lacto-ovo vegetarian with an annoying tendency to forget to book vegetarian meals when I go flying. When I forget to book ahead, I always ask if they happen to have an extra veg*n meal, but quite understandably they never do: they have precisely what has been pre-booked and nothing more. Which makes sense.</p><p>Whenever I <strong>do</strong> remember to book a veg meal well ahead of time, I always specify <em>lacto-ovo vegetarian</em> (i.e., with milk, cheese, cream, eggs, etc., just no fish or meat) if I can.</p><p>Despite this, I don’t believe I’ve ever actually been served a lacto-ovo vegetarian meal on any flight I’ve been on: the meal served is invariably <strong>vegan</strong>, despite me booking it well ahead of time as a lacto-ovo vegetarian one. Personally, I find this a bit annoying, because it means pretty much everything gets switched out for beans, rice, raw fruit, and crackers. Everyone else gets yoghurts and cakes—I get carrots and apple sauce. Boo.</p><p>I realise that the airlines don’t make the food themselves and have little control over what the dish of the day will be on any particular flight on any given day, but the fact that they do generally explicitly offer the choice between different kinds of veg*n meals would, I assume, imply that Gourmet Gate and similar flight meal companies do <em>make</em> these different variations of meals. If the companies that make the meals only made regular and vegan, there’d be no reason at all for the airlines to ask for any more details.</p><p>One also presumes that it would be very easy for these companies to make gradations. A lacto-ovo meal, for instance, would generally just have to switch one component (the meat in the main dish) for a veggie option, which my limited understanding of how meal factories work leads me to believe would be simpler and cheaper than a vegan meal where more or less everything is substituted. True, it would require some additional start-up cost to set up an extra packaging combination, but given the quantities of food these companies make, this extra cost doesn't seem like it ought to be prohibitive.</p><p>The way I see it, there are two basic tenets here that work against each other for the airlines:</p><ul><li>Offering a broad variety of dietary options is good PR and customer service</li><li>Having to pay for a broad variety of dietary options is bad for business</li></ul><p>Obviously a compromise between these two must be found. That is a given.</p><p>I have, on occasion, come across airlines who sacrificed customer service for business in this context and basically only offered a regular meal and a vegan meal. No other options. That's understandable and consistent, if not particularly satisfying for the customer.</p><p>The vast majority of airlines, however, seem to basically try to avoid the compromise altogether: they <strong>offer</strong> a full deck of dietary combinations, but once you get on the plane, they only actually <strong>provide</strong> regular or vegan.</p><p>To me, this seems to be a very strange decision. As a customer, I may be a bit disappointed to be told that I can only choose between regular and fully vegan, but at least my expectations are met. I am definitely going to be a lot more annoyed to be told that I've successfully booked a lacto-ovo meal, only to be given something different when I'm on the flight.</p><p>I have limited experience with halal, kosher, etc., but the few times I have travelled with people who booked meals like that, they have gotten special meals—not vegan ones. Conversely, as Itai mentions in the comments, lactose-intolerant people generally get served the vegan meal as well, and I've seen gluten-free bookings go the same way.</p><h3>So why do airlines nearly always <em>offer</em> a broad variety of dietary options, including lacto-ovo vegetarian and lactose- and gluten-free, when you book and order your meal; but conflate most non-regular options and only <em>provide</em> a vegan option on the actual flight?</h3>",

For context, I am expecting to declare around CA$3000 to CA$3500 in total value, ranging from all the clothes I’ve bought and worn to anything my parents have given to me to take home for personal use, down to small items like spare toothbrush heads and kettle descaling powder.</p><ol><li><p>How do customs officers calculate duties for goods without receipts?</p></li><li><p>When estimating dollar amounts for goods without receipts, is it better to be as precise as possible, or to overvalue them?</p></li><li><p>Is there an opportunity when speaking to an officer about paying duties and taxes to differentiate between items brought from Canada vs. items brought outside of Canada? I’ve been using pretty much everything I’m declaring during this trip and I’m worried they might tax me on items I brought from Canada but no longer have receipts for (like my electric shaver).</p></li></ol><p>Thank you in advance. Again, I've been extremely anxious about this whole situation and I want to make sure that I follow customs laws and be prepared for any future situations that may arise.</p>",

        "Body": "<p>I'll be taking several long-haul flights over the next month. From previous experience I know I'll probably be getting a fair bit of single-use plastic. I am keen on minimising waste, particularly plastic. In my daily life I do this by avoiding anything wrapped in plastic - if it's absolutely unavoidable, I try to find a way to reuse it.</p><p>On a flight however, it seems like my options are very limited. I've thought about bringing my own cutlery, but I'm concerned the single-use cutlery provided will just get thrown out anyway. There's also the plastic coverings, which are probably recyclable, but I can't recall seeing them being separated from the general rubbish. There's probably things I haven't thought of as well.</p><p>What are some things I can do minimise the waste I am responsible for given that I'm on a flight? I also want to support organisations that are taking waste minimisation seriously. Are there airlines that are taking a pro-active approach to waste minimisation?</p><p>Edit: Thank you everyone for the answers. The general trend is order-of-magnitude arguments essentially saying if you take the flight, any other concern is insignificant. I want to make a few comments:</p><p>Firstly, no one has provided any data quantifying the environmental impact of 1kg CO2 emissions to (say) 1kg of single-use plastic that goes to landfill. Without this data then the arguments are heuristic at best (although I don't doubt which way the conclusion will fall).</p><p>Secondly, CO2 off sets are a thing, and if the companies providing them are to be believed, then your global warming contribution is negated. If that is the case, then the next thing to work on is the waste you generate. </p>",

This can be any station between the Reservation From station and  Reservation Upto station. By default, you Reservation From station is  also your boarding point.</p>    <p>While you may choose a boarding point as any station on the route of  the train, you would have to pay the fare as applicable for  Reservation From – Reservation To stations. For example, if you are  booking a ticket from Mumbai Central to New Delhi and choose the  boarding point as Kota Jn, then you can board the train only at Kota  Jn and not between Mumbai Central and Kota Jn. You would however have  to pay the fare for Mumbai Central to New Delhi</p></blockquote><p>The question left unanswered is <strong>why would you want to do this</strong>?

I'll probably be travelling with a handful of vials as he'll need a supply before I can get a new prescription for him from a local vet upon arrival.</p><p>It's delivered to me using those freezer packs, but as they're a gel they won't get through security (I assume). I can't think of any other way to transport this on my person. Can anyone offer some guidance as to how I can keep it cold throughout my travels?</p><p>I'll be travelling from Manchester Airport (MAN) with Thomas Cook Airlines, and from JFK with American Airlines, if it helps.</p><p><strong>UPDATE POST TRAVEL (8 April 2019)</strong></p><p>I chose to travel with ice packs. Travel happened on 4th and 5th April 2019, and involved clearing security at both Manchester airport in the UK, and JFK in the US. Both times I informed security that the bag I was carrying contained insulin that needed to be kept cold, and 2 ice/freezer packs. On both occasions they took the bag and scanned it separately, swabbed it for the various things they swab for, and cleared it with no further issues. Neither of them asked for documentation to prove it was required. I think it also helped that the box of cartridge refills was still sealed, but it also had the product details printed on it, along with a prescription label.</p><p>At JFK the agent said that the ice packs should have been completely frozen, but due to various delays and the odd schedule we had, we were at the airport for around 6 hours before we were able to check the dogs in and clear security, so they weren't solid ice. That, and the freezer at our hotel didn't work very well, so one of them was barely frozen by the time it came to clearing security. He consulted with his supervisor who allowed him to clear it anyway after a swab.</p><p>So in conclusion; YES - you can travel with ice packs. Make sure you tell the security agent it's medication that needs to be kept cold. They'll most likely just swab it and allow it to pass. They might say that the ice packs must be completely frozen, but they seem to have enough common sense to do due diligence on it and allow you to proceed.</p>",

I was also in a rush as my accommodation has ordered me to leave, but I do not have proof of this in writing unfortunately.</p><p>I am now trying to claim these extra fees back from my insurance company but they are stating that because the FCO (UK Govt) did not announce non essential travel until the 17th March I have no claim. </p><p>The exact wording in my travel policy for curtailment is:</p><blockquote>  <p>If you have to curtail your trip as a result of the Travel Advice Unit of the Foreign & Commonwealth Office  (FCO), the World Health Organisation (WHO) or similar body recommending evacuation from the country or  specific area in which you are travelling, providing the directive came into force after you purchased this  insurance and after you have left your Country of Residence to commence the trip (whichever is the later).</p></blockquote><p>And the reply from my insurance company was:</p><blockquote>  <p>Unfortunately, from the information you provided, it would appear as shown above, the reason you abandoned your trip is not included in the specified incidents for which cover is provided under the policy.   You paid the fee to amend your flight on the 15th of March, however, the FCO advice to travel to/from France came into force on the 17th of March. We are therefore unable to consider your claim further.</p></blockquote><p>This is really cheeky of them and they clearly don't want to pay out. I need some advice on the fact that I was already abroad at the time of this announcement - the host country has ordered everything to close and therefore my trip will be cut short. </p><p>What points can I argue that my policy is in fact valid and I am due a refund?Thanks</p><p>EDIT 20/04: Thanks for all of your responses. A mixture of these answers managed to help. My claim was denied 3 times, 2x for curtailment and 1x for piste closure. In the end this was just ridiculous and I wasn't going to be bullied by an insurance company. I complained to the underwriters of the insurance policy but they didn't reply so I publicly complained and rated the insurance company that I brought the policy with. I won't name the website I complained on but they are a very popular public consumer facing review website. My claim was then honored only 8 hours later stating that it was incorrectly denied, funny eh?</p><p>FYI - It was a mixture of the actual reasonable grounds for curtailment, the FCA guidance that they had to be flexible, and the public facing 1* review for how I had been treated which honored my claim. </p>",

This is the biggest reason why I haven't been in any swimming pool in about a decade, back during my puberty.</p><p>Since it's that long ago since I have last been in a public pool, none of my swimwear fits me anymore, so I need to buy new.

Of those, trunks, board-shorts and swim briefs are right out. the other options give more coverage and would likely make me feel less naked. In fact, I would prefer to wear a wetsuit wherever possible, but I'm not sure whether most swimming pools even accept those, since they might cite the hygienic concerns they have with swimming shorts.</p><p>Are wetsuits accepted in Belgian and Western European swimming pools? or should I look for another option?</p><hr><p>I want to clarify that it's not attracting attention that I'm concerned about (as most people have assumed in their answers and comments). I'm concerned about running around in a small piece of fabric that covers very little, more specifically a speedo-style pair of briefs, and is quite easily depantsable (although that's not as much of a risk anymore in my mid-twenties).

People would stop eating or reading or smiling and just keep looking at me till I am done and I am sure they are expecting me to take a bomb out or something like that!  If any one else stood up and opened a compartment no one would even care!</p><p>Same exact looks were also found in a train from Paris to Amsterdam. The funny part is when we arrive people who gave me those looks would smile at me and some even would talk or ask questions...it is like they are thanking me for not killing them :)</p><p>Another time I was taking a helicopter tour in New York, and when we were onboard there were two young American ladies and they were kinda shocked to see me and my friend onboard, They literally were making prayers and looking at us! And again after we landed they were talking to us and even took pictures together!</p><p>Another example would be in restaurants specially fancy ones, malls or museums.</p><p>Another funny thing, my friend's name is <code>Osama</code> and he has all funny kinds of treatment because of his name. People sometime can be so superficial and treat someone in a suspicious way just because his name.</p><p>For me it's funny but not always! Sometimes this bothers me a lot specially when you are the one being picked up from hundreds of people for a random check from a police officer and the way they deal with you sometimes is totally weird, they treat you like a potential threat while all you were doing is having some fun!</p><p><strong>What's the best way to avoid this?</strong></p>",

        "Body": "<p>We have a trip ahead in South America that includes about 4 days in Cusco - Machu Picchu region. The main purpose of this part is obviously to see Machu Picchu, a bit of the Sacred Valley, catch a glimpse of Cusco and possibly one more place in that region, maybe Tipon.</p><p>We are traveling to Cusco by plane from practically zero altitude, so one of the major things to consider is <a href=\"https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/4245/avoiding-or-minimising-altitude-sickness\">minimizing the risk of altitude sickness</a> when planning the itinerary. The scheduled arrival time is around 10 am in the morning, but this is after several flight connections. Should something go wrong and we miss a flight on the way, we might not make it to Cusco till the evening, which further imposes risks on the decision about the date that we should buy Machu Picchu tickets for, since those are bought in advance and cannot be modified easily.</p><p>As you can guess, the question is how to plan these 4 days. Since Cusco is very high (3400 meters), I don't consider it an option to sleep there the first night. Better would be Ollantaytambo (~2800 m) or even Aguas Calientes (~2000 m) in case we can make it there.</p><p>The second issue to consider is that each one of us is traveling with a luggage of 12-15 kg and a small backpack of 3-4 kg. Obviously we would like to spend as little time without access to our luggages as possible, preferably no nights at all.</p><p>Traveling to Aguas Calientes with the luggage can be problematic, especially since we'll be there in the high season, although still <a href=\"https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/18168/how-strict-are-luggage-restrictions-on-the-incarail-train-to-machu-picchu-aguas\">possible</a>. In case we are willing to pay extra for that option, how can this be arranged, and how much extra will that be on top of the regular train ticket prices? In this case we would spend the first two nights in Aguas Calientes, see Machu Picchu on day two, and the third day heading back to Ollantaytambo and probably to Cusco the fourth day.</p><p>If that's too risky or simply doesn't work in the high season, it seems that staying in Ollantaytambo the first night and leaving the luggage there is the best option. We would go see a bit of the Sacred Valley the second day, sleep in Aguas Calientes, then see Machu Picchu on day three, head back to Ollantaytambo in the evening to meet our luggage again and sleep there, then head to Cusco on day four. The obvious disadvantage of this alternative is that we are spending one night without the luggage, we should find a safe place to store it in Ollantaytambo for maybe over 36 hours (where?), and that we are spending the first night at around 2800 meters instead of the appealing 2000 meters option.</p><p>This is what I could come up with so far, but all different itinerary ideas are also welcome, as long as they match our restrictions and preferences. Lots of people on the internet write about how <em>less is more</em> and you should try to travel without a luggage and everything, but it will be a long and exhausting journey and this is really not what we want. We're not traveling on extremely tight budget, meaning that we are alright with taking trains as such, but only as long as the prices are reasonable. This means that we don't want to pay a hundred dollars just to take the luggages with us on the train, finances are still a part of the equation as it is to most people on SE.</p><p>Surprisingly, out of the several countries that we are planning to visit, this region has been the toughest to plan. I hope to shape the remaining part with your feedback and ideas. Thanks in advance.</p><p>Edit: please note that the main question is <em>not</em> how to deal with the altitude sickness, rather what's the best route plan under very common restrictions such as traveling with a luggage and keeping in mind the altitude sickness.</p>",

The hotel had the right to charge me a 100% cancellation or change fee, but the hotel did not pre-reserve any money - the full payment was meant to be done on our arrival.</p><p>I changed my plans, and needed one more day at the hotel, so I checked the prices. I was shocked to see that the same stay was $800 cheaper than when I booked it! The site says that there are still 3 rooms left, and now the price is at a 15% discount (which is a totally not true, since they stated otherwise on the first reservation I made, the math does not check here...)</p><p>I contacted the hotel multiple times stating that I want the price changed to the actual one, since I feel cheated on that, but have not been answered for over a week now. </p><p>I'm wondering what are my options now. Should I cancel the first reservation, block my credit card not to be charged and rebook the room at a lower price? What are the consequences of such behaviour? </p><p>I mean, it's a lot of cash, but at the same time I feel that the hotel has cheated me into paying more (30%, to be honest), which is totally unfair and against all rules.</p><p>I don't want to be forced to pay it twice if something goes wrong! Can the hotel seek the payment when I arrive for my other reservation? Could there be any problems with checking in/out or even getting in or out of the country?

I have read of cities that have been built in the \"middle of nowhere\" which could have independent road networks. Also vast land masses with a challenging nature such as Antarctica or Greenland possibly have separate road networks which are not connected to each other nor to any other land mass.

I had stopped at the stop-sign, checked for traffic, then proceeded on, whereupon a police officer started flashing his lights at me. He asked where I was coming from, and whether I'd had my turn signal on, stating that he hadn't seen one. I answered him honestly that I was coming from karaoke in Oakland, and that I had had it on, the left turn signal specifically. He did some checks on his laptop and then sent me on my way. In retrospect, since it was a little after 2 AM, he was probably randomly pulling people over, knowing that the odds were that he could find someone who was driving inebriated after leaving the closing bar, the turn signal being a flimsy excuse for probable cause. That said, it made me wonder, which turn signal should be on in this sort of situation?</p><p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bQsD3.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bQsD3.jpg\" alt=\"Merging onto Panther Hollow Rd\"></a></p><p>One option is to have the left turn signal on, since you are merging left into traffic. On the other hand, I'd come to a complete stop, and a left turn signal might confuse people into thinking that I planned on a left turn (not feasible here, but possible in some other merging situations) and one does sort of have to turn right from the side street to get onto the main street. Reading through the PA traffic manual didn't help. Poking through the Kentucky and Ohio ones (they were convenient) didn't bring up any helpful laws for how to properly signal a merge.

My instinct is that crossing the road would be unsafe and so other options would probably be better if there is not a safe pedestrian route to the terminal from there.</p><p>[EDIT]From the answers, it appears a popular option is public transport.  One of the biggest considerations with that route would be a drop off/collection point outside the <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ULEZ</a>.  A small local bus fare would not invalidate such an answer.</p>",

        "Body": "<p>Sometimes, it is desirable to identify a particular train rather than just finding any train that travels to a given destination. For instance, discounted train tickets in Germany are usually valid only on a particular train.</p><p>Train station display various information on scheduled trains, and my questions refers to that information. I would like to identify the information relevant for my particular train on such displays. <strong>This question is <em>not</em> about how to recognize the train when it is already waiting at the platform (as it might be too late then and I like to wait on the platform before the train arrives).</strong></p><p>When travelling by train in e.g. Germany and France, information on trains is displayed along with the unique (per day) number of the train (cf. e.g. <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Bahn_Stuttgart#/media/File:Infotafel_Stuttgart_Hbf_Umleitung.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this display from Germany</a>, or <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahnhof_Paris-Nord#/media/File:Gare_du_Nord_Fallblattanzeiger_Departure-board.JPG\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this one from France</a>).</p><p>However, in Switzerland and in Austria, the train number seems to be missing (cf. e.g. <a href=\"http://info24.jimdo.com/2009/09/02/st%C3%B6rungen-auf-dem-sbb-netz-am-31-august-2009/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the first photo in this article from Switzerland</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/62456117@N00/6902427096\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this photo from Austria</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.bahnbilder.de/bilder/eine-beiden-grossen-anzeigetafeln-innsbrucker-228215.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this one, also from Austria</a>*).</p><p>Now, I <em>might</em> be able to figure out which one is my train (even though it still seems risky to me, if an earlier train to the same destination happens to be delayed) if I know its departure time and its destination. However, especially for the destination, this is unlikely - unless I happen to ride that train all the way until its final destination, neither am I interested in where the train travels to after I got out, nor do I usually even know (at least German online tickets for trains do not indicate the final destination of the booked trains, I would have to specifically retrieve that information from the online itinerary system).</p><p><strong><em>Practical example:</strong> When taking an IC train from Mannheim (blue marker in the map below) to Mainz (green marker), depending on the exact time of travel, the final destinations of these trains (red/orange markers) are Düsseldorf, Greifswald, Hamburg-Altona, Magdeburg, Münster, Dortmund, Cologne, and Mainz itself. While many of these are at least roughly on route when extrapolating the path from Mannheim to Mainz, it is, for instance, geographically rather counterintuitive to travel toward Magdeburg or Greifswald (orange markers) when one wants to go to Mainz:</em></p><p><img src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?size=400x400&markers=color:red|D%C3%BCsseldorf|Hamburg|M%C3%BCnster|Dortmund|K%C3%B6ln&markers=color:orange|Greifswald|Magdeburg&path=Mannheim|Mainz&markers=color:blue|size:mid|Mannheim&markers=color:green|size:mid|Mainz\" alt=\"Route from Mannheim to Mainz and some final destinations of trains that you can use for that route\"></p><p><em>So, even if you know where the final destination displayed for a train is, it is by no means guaranteed you could, without any further info, use that information to determine which train is yours.</em></p><p>Therefore, my primary question is: <strong>How are travellers \"officially\" supposed to identify one's train on such displays in Austria and Switzerland; what's the idea on how to use the information displays there when the train number is not visible?</strong></p><p>A secondary question, which is kind-of contained in the above (only if someone happens to know; I think it would improve the answer), is <em>why</em> train numbers are not displayed as well in Austria and Switzerland, as internally, surely they must exist (obviously so for e.g. publicly numbered German trains that cross the border).</p><p>*Interestingly, the <a href=\"http://www.bahnbilder.de/name/galerie/kategorie/oesterreich~sonstiges~zugzielanzeiger/digitalfotografie/24.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">source page of that Austrian photo</a> also shows various displays from Austria that do show train numbers. So, in Austria, the issue I observed only seems to apply to some stations.</p><p>EDIT: While Swiss and Austrian railways may not offer any tickets bound to specific trains, German railways sells such tickets for trips to and through Austria and/or Switzerland. As such, it is usually necessary at some point to identify a particular German train in a Swiss or Austrian station.</p><p>EDIT2: Another use case would be travelling in a group where some people board a train at a later time than the others. In such a case, they would need to make sure they are referring to the exactly same train, not just a train around a certain time towards a given place.</p>",

They kept this very quiet until you got to the end, and it was too late to change your plans!</p><p>For my next trip, I should have more time (I land mid-afternoon, but I'm not meeting friends until after work). I know that with other airports with high charges for the public transport connection, there's often a hidden way to avoid it that locals know. (In Sydney for example, there's a bus that'll take you a couple of miles to a normal railway station, or you can walk just over a mile to another one).</p><p>What I'm wondering is if there's something like that for JFK? I'm aiming to get to either lower Manhattan, or Brooklyn Heights. Can I get either to a subway station, or all the way down to somewhere like that, without having to pay the airtrain exit fee? (The subway from out by the airport to Brooklyn/Manhattan is only $2.25, and the current airtrain exit fee is an extra $5, so anything involving private buses/shuttles will likely work out much more!)</p>",

(Incidentally, that bag -- like much of my luggage -- is from <a href=\"http://www.antler.co.uk/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Antler</a>, a brand I've found to generally strike a reasonable compromise between price and quality.)</p><p>For things that shouldn't get squished, like my scuba gear, I used an ancient Samsonite plastic hardcase, which suffered many a hard knock over the years and finally gave up the ghost when the lock broke.  But now I understand that plastic is lame and all the cool kids are using polycarbonate hardcases, ideally the <a href=\"http://www.premiumluggage.com.au/rolling-hardside-travel-luggage/rimowa.html?m=100&b=48\" rel=\"noreferrer\">original Rimowa Salsa/Topas</a>:</p><p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hgn1M.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p><p>At $1000+ a pop here in Oz those are way out my target price range, but everybody's now making copies and eg. Antler's \"<a href=\"http://theluggageprofessionals.com.au/suitcases-and-luggage/suitcases/antler-liquis-4-wheel-medium-rollercase.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Liquis</a>\" goes for $300 or so, which is a bit more that I'd like to pay but not entirely out of the question -- if it really is worth it.

I submitted a request to Norwegian Air Shuttle requesting a compensation of 400 Euros under EU 261/2004.</p><p>Their reasoning for why they can not grant compensation is that while they had to inspect the aircraft for technical faults, there actually were no faults. So, they argue that this situation where they had to inspect the aircraft but actually there was nothing wrong with it <em>constitutes exceptional circumstances.</em></p><h2>Question</h2><p>In my complaints to the The Norwegian Travel Complaint Handling Body, and the EU Online Disputes Resolution, how should I most effectively argue against this logic? Are they correct that this \"inspection that found nothing\" constitutes exceptional circumstances?</p><p><hr><hr><hr></p><h2>Full text of refusal e-mail</h2><p>The full text (emphasis mine) of the response of the airline (automatically translated from the <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/C5ZpfxwA\" rel=\"noreferrer\">original Danish)</a>:</p><blockquote>  <hr>    <h1>Flight disruption information</h1>    <p><strong>Norwegian flight:</strong> DY1874 (OSL-FCO) 23.06.2019 </p>    <p><strong>Delay time:</strong> 4 hours and 40 minutes </p>    <p><strong>Reason for disruption:</strong> This flight  was <strong>delayed due to an inspection</strong> of the aircraft following a <strong>possible</strong>  <strong>technical fault</strong>. During inspection, <strong>no technical defect was found</strong>. The  aircraft was then released for operation without the need to replace  any components.</p>    <hr>    <p>Unfortunately, we are unable to meet your claim for compensation as  <strong>this departure was delayed due to exceptional circumstances</strong>. In some  cases, the passenger will be entitled to compensation when the  irregularity is due to a technical error. This is in accordance with  the judgment in C-257/14 van der Lans, where a technical error which  results in the replacement of a component can be considered to be  within the airline's control and thus give the right to compensation.  In this case, <strong>there was no technical fault and no components were replaced. The Van der Lans decision is therefore not applicable and unfortunately we cannot meet your claim for compensation.</strong>   In this case, we will reimburse the following expenses applied for:</p>    <ul>  <li>food: NOK 418,</li>  </ul>    <p>Unfortunately, we are unable to meet the request for reimbursement of  all costs as we are not responsible for these. For further  information, please see below *.</p>    <p>In order to process your claim, we need the following information to  make a bank transfer:</p>    <p>• Name of the bank • Name and address of the account holder • Account  number</p>    <p>This information can be sent by replying to this email. If you do not  have this information, please contact your bank.</p>    <p>The case will be finalized as soon as we have received all the  necessary information.</p>    <p>With best regards, Karina The Customer Relations Team</p>    <hr>    <ul>  <li>Basis for decision</li>  </ul>    <p>In the event of a cancellation or delay, we will always provide  assistance (eg accommodation, meals, telephone calls and transport)  according to EU Regulation 261/2004. In the event that a passenger  incurs such costs, in the event of a delay or cancellation, we will  reimburse within reasonable limits if such costs were deemed necessary  and specified receipt can be presented. We cannot reimburse these  costs if the passenger does not allow us to offer this kind of  assistance or if the costs arose as a result of lost connection with  Norweigan, in a separate booking number, or if the alternative  departures offered to the passenger , was not appropriate. The  Norwegian ticket will only be refunded if the flight is canceled or  the delay is over 5 hours and the passenger chooses not to travel. If  the passenger is entitled to reimbursement of the new ticket (with  Norwegian or with another company), we will only reimburse the cost of  the new ticket or the price difference between the new ticket and the  ticket with Norwegian if the Norwegian ticket is refunded.</p>    <p>Additional costs not directly linked to the service regulated by EU  Regulation 261/2004 will only be reimbursed <strong>if the reason for the</strong>  <strong>delay or cancellation is within our control</strong>. If we believe that the  passenger has not done enough to ensure that the pre-booked  arrangements can be completed (eg relocations, accommodation, events,  etc.), we will not be able to cover these costs even if the delay or  cancellation is within our control . Likewise, we cannot cover  consequential non-documented damages, expenses that would have arisen  independently of the irregularity, or unnecessary legal assistance to  determine such claims. Under the Montreal Convention and the decision  of the Norwegian Aviation Complaints Board in case number 1222 / 14F,  the same conditions apply to reimbursement of consequential damages,  provided that the airline has made every effort to avoid the technical  problems that caused the delay or cancellation of the flight. Under  Article 12 of the EU Regulation 261/2004, additional costs that are  not directly related to the service regulated by the regulation may be  deducted from standard compensation.

This cost me no legal fees at all. Thanks for the help!</p>",

He has various reasons for that: </p><ol><li>In case of emergency it is more probable that the electronic is working in front of the train. Therefore it is easier to open doors and get out of the train. He compares that with seats on a place directly around a emergency exit. </li><li>The driver of a vehicle always protects his side unconsciously. I can follow this argument in case of a car, but how should it work in a train? </li><li>Cars at the end of a train have a higher chance to derail.</li></ol><p>So I'm not sure who is right.

I discovered the problem when I arrived in a hotel and wanted to check in. The card was refused, and the person at the reception invited me to go to an ATM in order to bring some cash, as the hotel accepts only payment by card or cash, and won't accept a bank transfer. But when I tried to get the necessary amount of cash, the ATM plainly rejected the card without even asking for the PIN code. A few other ATMs behaved the same, and the card wouldn't work in a supermarket either.</p><p>I called my bank, but they just confirmed that there is absolutely nothing wrong with my bank account, and nothing is blocked, so the problem was really with my debit card. The only option they suggested is to try a different ATM. It should be noted that this bank doesn't have any subsidiaries in Ireland.</p><p>Thankfully, I wasn't traveling alone, and so I could deal more or less with the difficulty of not being able to get my own money. This made me think, however, of what could have happened if I was alone or if the person I was traveling with wouldn't lend me a rather important amount of money to pay the hotel (as well as food and other expenses).</p><p>So, let's pretend that as a French citizen, I'm alone in either Ireland or the UK, I have no more than twenty Euros in cash, and my debit card stops working (or I lose it or it gets stolen) while I need about six hundred Euros to pay to the hotel <em>right now</em>.

I'll put the full scenario in quotes, as I'm not sure if the whole story really adds to the question.</p><p>We are unsure of what to do with the ticket. The officer didn't explain anything (he was very rude and threatening, as you can read in the scenario), the paper we got says very little other than 'to report to court within 15 days otherwise a warrant for your arrest will be made'. We left the country hours after we got the speeding ticket. What do we do now? We wish to visit the US/Texas again.</p><p>And would it be possible for us to fight the ticket? We believe it was unfair and unnecessary. </p><blockquote>  <p>We just changed onto a different interstate. Previous interstate was  75mph, we couldn't find any signs but people were going faster than  75mph so we decided to 'go with the flow' and drive about 74/75. After  only minutes on the interstate we got pulled over. The officer came to  the car with his gun drawn (yes, really!) yelling at us not to move.  He wouldn't let us speak, he wouldn't let us move. He asked questions  but didn't let us finish the answers. We made it very clear we were  tourists in a rental car, yet he proceeded to ask us if we were  Californian citizens (the car had a Cali license) multiple times.  After the 3rd time we said we explained where we were from he finally  put the gun away. He told us what we did wrong and when we tried to explain we were tourists and were just trying to do the right thing, he told us to stop talking. He told us to report to court within 15 days and  when we tried to explain we were leaving the country and didn't know what to do and he told us in a  very threatening way we 'better report to court within 15 days or a  warrant would be put out'.</p>    <p>This all happened at election night, I hope the officer was just  having a bad day and this is NOT a normal experience with the law in  the US.

It doesn't have to be their first language. For example, perhaps Germany's \"official\" German would be understood by anyone in the first group (and perhaps the third group as well?) who doesn't understand English, and then some Scandinavian language would be understood by almost everyone in the second group. Or perhaps France's \"official\" French could be substituted for German, gaining all of France (and northern Italy?) without losing anyone?

Or maybe English is enough since I'm not asking about carrying long conversations well, just about being understood.</p><p>I've already seen <a href=\"https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/35348/91152\">As a native English speaker, which two further languages would give me the most travel utility worldwide?</a> but that's worldwide.</p><p><strong>EDITS</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/157554/are-there-a-few-languages-that-along-with-english-will-let-a-person-be-underst#comment393044_157554\">A comment</a> says that it \"Feels like a flawed question\" because I couldn't learn another language as well as the \"vast majority of people in NW Europe\" know English. Besides the fact that many other answers here say that that (that the vast majority know English) is wrong, and besides the fact that even if that is true, that would simply be the answer (that there is no need for any other language) and not knowing the answer doesn't make a question flawed, it also completely misunderstands the question (by assuming I would like to learn a language that others already know).</p><p>From the comments, it seems that some misunderstood the question. So:</p><ul><li>If a person there understands a basic English - I won't need anotherlanguage to communicate with said person. (I'm not trying to compose apoem for them, just do some basic communication.) I'm asking about additional languages for communication with those who don't understand enough English for a <em>simple</em> conversation.</li><li>If 51% of a country speaks a language I know (e.g. English), that is notthe \"vast majority\" (mentioned in the title). If 51% of the populationof a country understands English, that means that in areas out of thetourist areas and big cities one is likely to have a hard time because oflack of a common language.</li><li>Learning a language <em>well</em> can take a lot of time so might be impractical.

There are a few precautions I take when eating to reduce the risk of food getting stuck in my esophagus, one of them being taking a drink with every swallow. Naturally, this means I consume a fair amount of water during a meal.</p><p>While traveling to France and Germany recently, I had a bit of a hard time getting enough water during my meal. I can't just ask for a pitcher of (tap) water like I can in the USA. In Europe, when you order water, you get bottled water<sup>1</sup>, and specifically requesting tap water is bad etiquette.</p><p>But one bottle of water isn't enough.</p><p>Is there a way I can request a sufficient supply of (still) water, without breaking etiquette rules?</p><p>The only option I've thought of is ordering multiple bottles of water (which, depending on the meal and the bottle size, could easily be 4+), but that's: expensive, potentially wasteful (if I order more than I need), and a little weird. I don't mind revealing my swallowing issues, though preferably if I must, I'd do so with a very concise explanation.</p><p><sub><sup>1</sup>And hopefully I remembered to ask for <em>still</em> water.

My initial assumption was based on my previous experience, in which I was eating at a restaurant in Paris (I can't recall it's name, but it was quite popular (but not expensive)). When I asked the waitress for tap water as my drink (and declined wine and other drink options), she was visibly shocked and upset. For the rest of the evening she either ignored me (and my wife), or if she had to interact with us, she had a permanent scowl directed at us.
